SailorV Arcade Game
===================
![IntroPic](http://i.imgur.com/soyLEXw.png)

A BTA from 2013 based on the unused sprites of the Sailor Moon arcade game. Nothing much here. 

At this date (04/2016), there's only a walking and scrolling game. I plan on finishing the fighting game someday, but it's not planned right now. I also need to refactor the code, since it's a real pain to the eye to watch! Feel free to contribute!
